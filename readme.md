## Gistr

Gistr is a web application built with Laravel and Vue.js that provides slightly better gist management which currently includes:

* the ability to filter the gists by search field
* the ability to add gists to favorites and switch between all/favorite gists
* zero-time loading pagination

Planned features:

* adding gists to folders
* adding/editing/deleting gists using the application interface
* API-like interface for easier retrieval of secret gists (without OAuth)


## Live Demo

A live demo of the application can be found at [http://codepeace.net/gistr/](http://codepeace.net/gistr/) (requires GitHub login only).
